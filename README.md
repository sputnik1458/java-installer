You must download the JDK from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html. You will want to download the file with this name: jdk-8u101-linux-x64.tar.gz (64-bit) or jdk-8u101-linux-x86.tar.gz (32-bit)

Leave the tar in your downloads folder. It can be deleted post-installation. 
Install by executing "bash java_installx64.sh" or "bash java_installx86.sh" within the java-installer directory.
