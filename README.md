# java-installer
Installs JDK-8u91 on 64-bit Linux systems

You must download the JDK from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html. You will want to download the file with this name: jdk-8u91-linux-x64.tar.gz

Leave the tar in your downloads folder. It can be deleted post-installation. 

Run the install script by executing "bash java_install.sh" within the directory or "./java_install" if the script is given exectuable permissions.
